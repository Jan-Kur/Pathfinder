## PLEASE READ
This project is special for me and there are a couple of reasons why:

1. I have really pushed my boundaries with this project. It‚Äôs the first time I am creating a web app. It‚Äôs also the first time I am using a javascript framework (Svelte with SvelteKit). I sat down one day and learnt Svelte in one sitting just to be able to create this project. It‚Äôs the first time I am using animations and optimized the website for mobile devices. And lastly, it‚Äôs the first time I am using localStorage to a larger extent (I once created a website with a theme switch and I stored just one variable in localStorage). I didn‚Äôt go with a database because (1) I didn‚Äôt have enough time and (2) didn‚Äôt want you guys to have to go through the login process, and I think localStorage is just fine for this project.
2. This is the only thing between me and the Ipad. I had 9 days to work 50+ hours on the project, which ment after coming from school I would have to code until (or often past) midnight with little breaks and without doing anything else whatsoever (I had to drop working out and running for example üòî). And that‚Äôs what I did. Oh, and I also skipped school twice üòÅ. All that will be worth it if I get enough votes and will be able to buy the Ipad which was my goal from the very beginning. It would be a game changer for me in school. 

I‚Äôm really happy with how this project turned out. I designed it as a day planner that I would use myself, but I hope you guys will enjoy it too!

## Project Overview

Pathfinder is a productivity app to plan your day and track your goals with a gamified approach. 

It‚Äôs devided into 3 main parts:

1. Timeline - You have a timeline for every day which you can target with the calendar. Add tasks there and create a schedule that you will follow during the day with the help of notifications.
2. Unscheduled tasks - There should go your to-dos for the day that you don‚Äôt know when will be doing. You can also just put all your tasks there if you don‚Äôt like the strict approach of the timeline.
3. Goals - Add up to 3 goals (because more is bad imo) and track your progress towards them. With the gamified approach you can add **checkpoints** on the path leading to the finish line. These are things you are doing towards your goal (for example if your goal is to loose weight, a checkpoint might be going to the gym). Each checkpoint has a timer with which you should track how much time are you actually working towords your goal, you will get 10 points for every minute to keep you motivated.
